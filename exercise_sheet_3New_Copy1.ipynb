Unless specified otherwise you may change the skeleton code as you wish, but your code must pass the formatting tests in the following code cell – if the cell runs without errors then your code is eligible for submission. However these will only test the basics of the question. Your code will be subject to additional hidden tests which will determine your grade. Make sure you thoroughly test your own code to check you think it works correctly before submission.\n",

You can entirely replace the contents of the folder called `exercise-files` with a fresh copy. You still only need to submit this `.ipynb` file when you are done, no extra files."
